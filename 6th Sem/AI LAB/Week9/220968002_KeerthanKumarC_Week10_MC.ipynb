    "# Conclusion and Summary of Results\n",
    "## Monte Carlo First Visit:\n",
    "- More stable but requires a higher number of episodes (~500+) for optimal learning.  \n",
    "- Ensures each state-action pair is updated only on its first occurrence in an episode, reducing variance in updates.  \n",
    "- Slower convergence but reliable in the long run.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Monte Carlo Every Visit:\n",
    "- Updates state-action values on every occurrence in an episode, leading to faster learning (~300-400 episodes).  \n",
    "- More sensitive to noise and initial randomness, making it less stable early on.  \n",
    "- Generally converges quicker but may require additional tuning for optimal performance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Overall Comparison:\n",
    "- **If stability is the priority**, First Visit MC is preferable despite slower convergence.  \n",
    "- **If faster learning is needed**, Every Visit MC can be more efficient, especially in shorter training runs.  \n",
    "- Both methods eventually learn the optimal policy, but the trade-off is between stability and speed of convergence.  "
