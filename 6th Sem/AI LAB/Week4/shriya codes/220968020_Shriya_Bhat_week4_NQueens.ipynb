    "# Performance Analysis of Hill Climbing Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of each algorithm is assessed based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Attacking Pairs**: The number of pairs of queens that attack each other in the solution.\n",
    "2. **Iterations**: The number of steps taken by the algorithm to reach the solution.\n",
    "3. **Restarts**: The number of restarts made by the algorithm if a local optima is encountered.\n",
    "4. **Execution Time**: The time taken by the algorithm to find a solution.\n",
    "5. **Success**: Whether the algorithm found a solution (True) or not (False).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Success Rates\n",
    "- **Simple Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - For smaller values of N (e.g., N=4, N=8), the Simple Hill Climbing algorithm often finds a solution (with a few attacking pairs).\n",
    "  - For larger values (N=32, N=64), it fails to find a solution, indicating that it struggles with larger problem sizes.\n",
    "- **Stochastic Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - This algorithm often produces solutions, but the number of attacking pairs is higher, especially for larger N.\n",
    "  - The algorithm has a higher tendency to get stuck in suboptimal solutions compared to Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing.\n",
    "- **Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - The Steepest Ascent variant performs the best in terms of minimizing attacking pairs and finding a solution.\n",
    "  - It consistently produces solutions with zero attacking pairs (N=4, N=8, N=16), which is an indication of its higher effectiveness compared to the other two algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterations and Restarts\n",
    "- **Simple Hill Climbing**: \n",
    "  - Generally requires more iterations to reach a solution, especially as N increases. It may get stuck in local optima, resulting in longer execution times.\n",
    "  - Only requires one restart per experiment, showing that it doesn't get stuck often, but still struggles with larger N.\n",
    "- **Stochastic Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - Stochastic Hill Climbing often finds a solution in fewer iterations but at the cost of more attacking pairs, particularly for larger N (e.g., N=32, N=64).\n",
    "  - Like Simple Hill Climbing, it also requires only one restart per experiment.\n",
    "- **Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - This algorithm generally requires more iterations than Stochastic Hill Climbing but tends to find better solutions with fewer attacking pairs.\n",
    "  - As the size of N increases, it still performs well with no restarts needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Time\n",
    "- **Simple Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - The execution time increases significantly as N increases. For N=64, the execution time is the longest (22.7 seconds), indicating that it becomes inefficient with larger problem sizes.\n",
    "- **Stochastic Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - The execution time remains extremely low, even for larger N. This suggests that the algorithm's random decisions may lead to faster (but less optimal) results.\n",
    "- **Steepest Ascent Hill Climbing**:\n",
    "  - The execution time is slightly higher than Stochastic Hill Climbing but significantly lower than Simple Hill Climbing for larger N. This suggests that the more targeted approach of Steepest Ascent is more efficient compared to Simple Hill Climbing.\n",
