# HPC LAB CODES

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

These codes are experimental and may not be entirely accurate. They are provided for reference only. Many of these codes might not be correct, but I have tried my best to ensure they are functional. 

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Starting from week 5, all code credits go solely to Akshay. All of his codes are on a god level, and I want to extend my gratitude for his contributions. 

Wishing you all the best in achieving great marks!
