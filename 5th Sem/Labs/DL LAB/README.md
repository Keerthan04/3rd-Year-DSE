# DL LAB CODES

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

These codes are experimental and may not be entirely accurate. They are provided for reference only. Please verify and modify them as needed before use. I also utilize GPT for clarification, so not all codes are guaranteed to be correct, but I strive for accuracy to the best of my knowledge.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

If you are submitting the same notebook, please ensure to change the title and the name within the notebook. I want to avoid seeing multiple notebooks with the same name !!PLEASE :) .

Wishing you all the best in achieving great marks!
